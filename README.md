SRMS – Student Report Management System

SRMS is a C/C++-based console application that offers a role-based login system (Admin, Staff, User, Guest) and basic student-record management. The repository contains the source files (`SRMS_AP24110010653.cpp`, `Simulation_SRMS.c`), alongside credential storage (`credentials.txt`) and a sample student data file (`students.txt`).  

Features  
- User authentication with multiple role levels  
- Add, view and manage student records  
- Simple command-line interface for easy operation  

 How to build & run  
Compile the `.cpp` or `.c` files using a C/C++ compiler (for example: `g++ SRMS_AP24110010653.cpp -o srms`). Then run the executable; login with your credentials, and follow on-screen prompts to manage student data.  

About  
SRMS provides a lightweight, text-based student result/report management solution — ideal for small-scale institutions or as a learning-project for basic file- and user-management in C/C++.
